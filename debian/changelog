wayland-ivi-extension (2.2.0-3) apertispro; urgency=medium

  * debian/control: Remove non-existing build dependency libegl1
    - Remove build dependency libegl1/libgles2 as it doesn't exist. The
      vendor neutral EGL, GLES packages are provided by Mesa in v2021
      and by GLVND from v2022 on-wards. Keep Mesa package as build
      dependency as it provides the development files in v2021 and has
      a install-time dependency to GLVND packages which provides the
      development files from v2022 on-wards.

      on wayland socket. As a result process waits on poll() for idefinite time
      even after receiving signal. Modify poll() to accept signals while
      listening to events on wayland socket.
